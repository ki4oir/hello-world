Hello all! This is my first repository! 

My name is Curtis.  I like coding.  I started learning to program with Microsoft BASICA back in the late 1980s by trial and error.  
I didn't have any training materials, except for a few books I came across.  I put programming aside for a while for career reasons, but I've been trying to pick back up where I left off.
